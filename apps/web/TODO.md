# TODO's

More like tools that can be useful in the future and stuff:

- [GASP](https://gsap.com/): A wildly robust JavaScript animation library built for professionals.

- Dashboard: Kinda like a dynamic carrousel

  - Adding some graphs as needed, maybe with Chart.JS
  - However, considering that's a data based application is kinda hard
    to put it inside a "plain" dashboard
  - Also giving that "Adventure vibe"
  - A Telescope moving based in every metric

    - _That could be dope_ > In first person

      - But that would require some 3D modeling, I guess

    - But, with this approach, the line for the expoplanets
      will be visible.

- [Tree.JS](https://threejs.org/) seems to be the tool for creating the
  dashboard

  - Maybe a 3D graph, that shows the path
